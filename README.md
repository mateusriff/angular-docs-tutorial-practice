# angular-docs-tutorial-practice

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/urtrt1)

This project was made following Angular's [Get Started](https://angular.io/start) project tutorial. It's a very basic e-commerce site with a catalog, shopping cart, and check-out form. It uses structural directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`, interpolation, property and event binding, decorators, methods and services and also first-party libraries like Angular's Router, Forms and HttpClient.
